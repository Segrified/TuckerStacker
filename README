A simple block stacking game

Press the S key to start, and press the S key again when the red block is aligned with the stack to build your tower

When you have a fully green tower, you win!

Be careful about the difficlty increase halfway through though.

This is currently in a really rough state, I'll be cleaning this up later, but wanted to get it in as fast as possible.
